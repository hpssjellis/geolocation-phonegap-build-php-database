# geolocation-phonegap-build-php-database
Using phonegap geolocation to update a database so a robot can follow your cell phone



Started on April 7th, 2015

This repo is intended to be loaded onto phonegap build to compile the App. It will also need a running php mysql server, which I may test on http://c9.io or use my own site.
