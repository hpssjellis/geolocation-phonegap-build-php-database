# geolocation-phonegap-build-php-database
Using phonegap geolocation to update a database so a robot can follow your cell phone



Started on April 7th, 2015

This repo is intended to be loaded onto phonegap build to compile the App. It will also need a running php mysql server, which I may test on http://c9.io or use my own site.



Informational video about cloud9 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K75wV8FybQ  will also show how to setup a php site. The mysql database stuff is in the advanced folder. Github site

Note: This should be able to be built at https://build.phonegap.com/people/sign_in  if you are linked to a github account you should be able to fork this and build it in about 60 seconds.
